### 38.Count and Say

> Description:The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
>
> ```
> 1.     1
> 2.     11
> 3.     21
> 4.     1211
> 5.     111221
> ```
>
> `1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
> `11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
> `21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.
>
> Given an integer *n*, generate the *n*th term of the count-and-say sequence.
>
> Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: 1
> Output: "1"
>
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: 4
> Output: "1211"
> ```
